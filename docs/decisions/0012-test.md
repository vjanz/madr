# ADR 21: Adopt Kubernetes for Service Orchestration

- **Deciders**: Valon
- **Date**: 2024-08-29
- **Status**: Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement
As our microservices architecture continues to grow, managing and orchestrating these services across different environments has become increasingly complex. We need a scalable and reliable solution to handle deployment, scaling, and management of our containerized applications.

## Decision Drivers
- Need for scalability and flexibility in managing microservices.
- Desire to standardize deployment and operations across environments.
- Requirement for high availability and automated recovery of services.
- Team familiarity with Kubernetes and existing DevOps practices.

## Considered Options
- **Option 1**: Continue using Docker Compose for orchestration.
- **Option 2**: Use a third-party PaaS like AWS ECS or GCP GKE.
- **Option 3**: Adopt Kubernetes as the orchestration platform.

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: **Adopt Kubernetes** because it offers the most comprehensive solution for our needs, including robust features for service discovery, load balancing, and automated scaling. Kubernetes also integrates well with our existing CI/CD pipelines and provides flexibility for future growth.

## Positive Consequences
- Improved scalability and resilience of services.
- Standardized deployment and management processes.
- Greater flexibility in deploying across multiple cloud providers.

## Negative Consequences
- Steeper learning curve for team members not familiar with Kubernetes.
- Increased complexity in setting up and managing Kubernetes clusters.
- Potential need for additional tooling to handle specific use cases not natively supported by Kubernetes.
